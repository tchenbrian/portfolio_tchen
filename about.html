    <h1 class="TabsH1">About</h1>

    <h2 id="aboutH2">A little bit about myself, what I have done, and where my interests lie.</h2>

        <h2 id ="backgroundH2">Background</h2> 
        <p id ="backgroundPara">I am a junior at Southwest CTA, a magnet high school that emphasizes project based learning and real world skills. In my upbringing, my family taught me three essential values: altruism, honesty, and hard work. I have maintained straight A's and a 4.0 unweighted GPA while taking several AP classes such as World History and English. </p>         
 
        <h2 id="experienceH2">Experience</h2>
        <p id = "experiencePara">My current vocation is in design, both in web and graphics. In the course of two years, I have developed proficiency in graphic design and web design. I have successfully taken on several clients and have designed for commercial and educational purposes. In extracurricular, I am currently a member of SkillsUSA, a national organization that hosts competitions for skills such as web design. Finally, I have earned Adobe certifications in Illustrator and Photoshop. </p>


        <h2 id="interestsH2">Interests</h2>
    <p id = "interestsPara"> As my years in design continue, I plan to incorporate my various interests into different websites. I have a profound interest in government and politics, for example. I can definitely see client work for political activism in my future. For hobbies outside of web design, I enjoy writing, computer gaming, and traveling. </p>
