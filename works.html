<h4>Logo Design</h4>
    
<h5>2015 NACTE Logo Design Contest - Spring 2015</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/Logo1Color.jpg" id="logo1" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/Logo2Color.jpg" id="logo2" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara"> I submitted two different logo designs for the annual NACTE logo design contest. This year's motto was "A Vision for Tomorrow." I attributed that motto to qualities such as progress, idealism, and technology and incorporated those elements into my designs. In retrospect, they both were visually appealing and symbolizing, something that I could appreciate in my graphic design work.</p> </a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>80 Years of Marketing Education - Winter 2015</h5>
    <ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/marketingLogo.png" id="Jayme" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">Into the second quarter of my junior year, it was time for another set of logos. This time, we had an actual client visit, Melissa Scott. We designed logos celebrating 80 years of Marketing Education as its anniversary was around the corner. I made it into the top ten with a very simple and clean logo that could also convey the anniversary feeling with subtlety. </p> </a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>60 Years of LVGEA - Early 2016 </h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/LVGEA.png" id="Jayme" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">Not long after, we had another anniversary logo on deck. Our latest clients were the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, the regional development company in Southern Nevada. For our work this time, we had to be more precise in conveying Nevada and the global reach of LVGEA. My two logos were simple and a bit lackluster, but they managed to be presentable and attempted to represent Nevada.</p></a></li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Animation</h4>

<h5>Fable Animation - Spring 2015</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/fableAnimation.jpg" id="fableAnimation" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara"> In Adobe Flash, my first major work was an animation of a fable of my choice. Over the course of the project, I had to make some interesting decisions in regards to graphics and director details. The overall process was a great introduction to Flash. I struggled a bit at first, but I quickly improved at the program and designed a well-put fable animation.</p> </a></li>
</ul>

<h5>Flash Shooter Game - Fall 2015</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/flash.png" id="flash" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara"> To prepare for the upcoming Adobe Flash ACA exam, it was essential that we had an understanding of ActionScript, the programming language of Flash. The learning experience was through a design of a video game with custom graphics and programming. The game ended up functioning well and appearing nicely and I definitely have a better understanding of ActionScript.</p> </a></li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Web Design</h4>

<h5>Dante's Inferno PBL - Spring 2015</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/inferno.png" id="inferno" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara"> This project featured my first real client in the Web Design field. My English teacher requested an educational website for upcoming sophomores that are asked to read The Inferno by Dante Alighieri. Teaming up in a group of five, we each had to make careful considerations of color scheme, client needs, and target audience. The information provided was accurate and informative, and the website ended up being presentable and organized. </p> </a></li>
</ul>

<h5>Business Card - Fall 2015</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/businessCard.jpg" id="businessCard" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">My portfolio also comes with a business card, containing basic contact information. Over the course of this year, I will continue to update my portfolio with new assets.</p> </a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>JavaScript Quiz - Fall 2015</h5>
    <ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/quiz.png" id="Jayme" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">JavaScript was a new experience for me as a web designer. It was my first experience into programming. For this project, we had to team into partners and create a quiz using the JavaScript we learned. This project ended up being difficult and tedious at first, but Raymond and I realized how simple it was by playing around with the language. Our CSS was a bit worse than usual, but our quiz was running smoothly.</p></a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>Responsive Website - Winter 2015 / Early 2016</h5>
    <ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/responsive.png" id="Jayme" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">The next website we completed was a redesign of the negatively received SWCTA site. We had to make it more logical, easier to navigate, and more appealing. To top it off, the next skill we learned was responsive design, which we learned throughout second quarter. This project was a hassle because of the specific requirements, but my group and I managed to pull it through. I am most satisfied with this work because I was able to make the site fully responsive while still looking visually clean and appealing.</p></a></li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Creative Design </h4>
    
<h5>Freshman Spring PBL - Spring 2014</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/springPBL.png" id="businessCard" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">Freshman year was when it all began. For this long two-month PBL, we had to create a realistic 3-D sculpture of an object of our choice. We were in groups of five and had to manage designing, modeling, building, and video documenting. This was one of the most stressful projects I have completed. I found the aspect of modeling to be difficult and we ended up crunching for time.</p></a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>Warhol Effect</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/Jayme.jpg" id="Jayme" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara"> This image may appear strange, but it is actually a visual effect developed by Andy Warhol, an American pop artist. I took a standard image of one of my teachers and used Photoshop to replicate the effect. The transition was not perfect, of course, but I gained quite a bit of insight on how Photoshop can implement painting techniques.</p> </a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>Holiday Card</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/holidaycard.jpg" id="holidayCard" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara"> Around the winter season, it was time to design a holiday card. Using Illustrator, I took a very symbolic approach to my card, choosing typical images of the holiday season such as snowflakes, candy canes, and bells.</p> </a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>Creativity Week</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/creativity.jpg" id="Jayme" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">The first week back in school in Graphic Design was one for creativity. Each of us participated in several activities that would test our creativity ingenuity and then watch TED talks that explain the thinking process. One figure even encouraged that high school students should be playing more. We culminated this week of creativity with a project to make something of value out of accumulated trash. With a bit of effort, we constructed a neat-looking movie theater.</p> </a></li>
</ul>
    
 <h5>Sketchbook Final Project</h5>
    <ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/sketchbook.png" id="businessCard" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">At the end of sophomore year, we had to choose a theme and explore it in-depth within our sketchook. Our exploration included discoveries of fonts, colors, and images that would relate to our theme. The following year, we took these ideas and put them into one final project. I can admit that my end product was a bit rushed, but the idea of "second chances" is definitely present throughout the design.</p> </a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>Vans Custom Culture</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/vans.png" id="businessCard" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">A project in the works! Vans hosted a shoe design contest for students, and the grand prize would be up to $50,000 for the art department at SWCTA. In groups, we had to develop, sketch, and draw our ideas for the shoes that had to relate to four themes: music, Las Vegas, action sports, and art. Our designs were polished and neat for this project, and we should definitely anticipate good results on the contest.</p></a></li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Community Service Projects</h4>
    
<h5>Hip Hop Meets IT</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/hipHop.jpg" id="Jayme" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">Hip Hop Meets IT was an event that had two worlds meet: Computer Science and Hip Hop. As two radically different things, we were in teaching young hip hop students about computer science in exchange for learning hip hop dance. It was an absolutely wonderful experience, both in the cultural exchance and meeting new people. My class was responsible for the graphics portion of the teaching session, specifically Photoshop. We ran through a successful short tutorial on how to accessorize someone in Photoshop, which the kids found a lot of fun.</p></a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>Adobe Voice</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/adobeVoice.png" id="businessCard" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">Adobe Voice was a new software that we learned. For this project, we had to form groups of four to five and sell a pitch for the annual Flight to Europe hosted by the foreign language department. To do so, we relied on our persuasive skills and speaking as well as the handy capabilities of the technology. Our videos were high-quality and made many want to visit Germany over the summer.</p></a></li>
</ul>
    
<h5>Hour of Code</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a><img src="_assets/images/hoc.png" id="Jayme" class="work"></a></li>
    <li><a><p class="logoPara">Hour of Code is the annual special hour when students all across the globe learn computer science, which is quickly becoming a prominent career path. This year was different for us SWCTA students, however. We had to teach computer science at Mark Finn Elementary School. Thankfully, we managed to adjust for the kids and show them some fun games to help them start making connections to coding and computers. It was a pleasurable experience to work with elementary schoolers again.</p> </a></li>
